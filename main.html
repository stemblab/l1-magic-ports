  <h2>$\ell_1-\mathrm{MAGIC}$</h2>

  [http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~justin/l1magic/,
  $\ell_1-\mathrm{MAGIC}$] is a suite of Matlab software for "solving
  the convex optimization programs central to compressive
  sampling". Here we consider ports to other languages.

  Presently only a stand-in for Matlab's linsolve.m function is
  provided to allow l1eq_pd.m to run in Octave.

  As a toy problem, consider solving $Ax=b$, where

  $$
  A=
  \begin{bmatrix}
  1&-1&1\\1&2&4
  \end{bmatrix},
  \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,
  b=\begin{bmatrix}1\\4\end{bmatrix}.
  $$

  Obviously we can't invert $A$, but if $x$ is known to be 1-sparse,
  then $x=[0~0~1]^T$ is a [/?id=b007z,unique solution]. In octave:

  <div data-file="./m/l1eq_pd_test.m" 
       data-start-match=""
       data-end-match="">
  </div>

  <pre id="l1eq_pd-1"></pre>

</div>
